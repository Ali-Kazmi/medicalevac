# Medevacwebsite

This project was created during my internship at GTRI (georgia tech research institute). Due to covid it was only a 5 week internship, but I learned angular and built this website! It helps helicopter pilots have an easier time planning which landing zone to use by recommending a spot to land. It also conveniently plots these on a map. Supports both lat/long and MGRS.

## Development server (after cloning) 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
